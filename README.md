# EnhancedHTML2
Help provide up to date information about Don Jone's module

The examples reference old parameters (now EvenRowCssClass/OddRowCssClass) and just leaves to many inexperienced people frustrated and unable to use it. I wanted to at least compile the example located https://devops-collective-inc.gitbook.io/creating-html-reports-in-powershell/building-the-html.

Save the file as Demo-EnahancedHTML2.ps1 and call it like this

Demo-EnhancedHTML2.ps1 'computername1','computername2' -path C:\Path\For\HTMLReport

Each report will be Computername.html
